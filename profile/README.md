# Waddle your way to ✨ Huddle 🐧 

## About  

Huddle is a platform that makes finding hangout spots simple and quick. The name **"Huddle"** represents individuals coming together—a place of comfort and connection.  

## Inspiration  

Huddle is inspired by the **New Zealand Blue Penguin**, also known as the **Little Blue Penguin** or **Kororā**. As the world’s smallest yet most social penguin, they gather in groups for warmth and companionship.  

Just like these penguins, Huddle brings people together. Whether you're looking for the perfect hangout spot or a place to meet friends, Huddle makes it easy—because the best moments happen together.
